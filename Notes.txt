Haar Cascade: 
1. It is a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier model, specially designed to detect Russian licence plates in images or videos.

2. It is stored in XML file format for easy loading and use within openCV.

3. How does it works?
(3->A)  Haar Features:
The model uses Haar-like features, which are simple rectangular patterns that capture intensity differences within an image region. These features are efficient for real-time object detection.

Cascade classifier:
The classifier is organised as a cascade of stages, where each stage consists of a set of Haar features and thresholds.
An image region only passes to the next stage if it meets the criteria of the current stage. 
This cascade structure allows for fast rejection on non-plate regions, focussing computation on potential candidates.
